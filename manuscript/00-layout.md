### In-World Asides

Occasionally, this book will include _in-world_ asides - by which we mean these are narrative pieces or information given from the perspective of a person in Pentola.
They will always be rendered like this:

{icon=pen-nib}
G> #### On Pentolan Literacy
G>
G> It is often said, especially by those bright scholars of the Aydinlar Empire, that Pentolans have no grasp of letters.
G> This is, obviously, false.
G>
G> For example, I am a Pentolan, and I'm writing this field guide.
G>
G> There is, however a grain of truth - the vast and multitudinous population of our city does not, largely, know how to read and write.
G> Nor do they need to!
G> Most of them have apprenticed to a Guild or learned the Craft from a family member or friend - and we teach all of our children the _Auratic Vision_ and _Message_ dweomers, of course.
G>
G> Most Pentolans never learn to read not, as the Aydlinars would have you believe, because their lack of enlightenment leaves them unable to do so, but _simply because it isn't necessary_.
