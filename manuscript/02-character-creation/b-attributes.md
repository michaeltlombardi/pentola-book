# Calculating Attributes

Once you have rolled for your starting characteristics you can determine your attributes.
These are pools of points which represent your ability to sustain damage (in the case of hit points) and use magic or special abilities (in the case of power points).

+ **Hit Points (HP):** Add your character's Bone and Iron - the 'tens' digit is their HP.
+ **Power Points (PP):** Add your character's Flax and Iron - the 'tens' digit is their PP.
