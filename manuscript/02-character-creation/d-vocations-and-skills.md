# Vocations and Skills

## Vocations

Characters each have a vocation - a calling or an occupation to which a character is inexorably drawn and which helps to define them.

Whenever your character is faced with a test which can be reasonably argued to be relevant to their vocation you may add your vocation bonus to the test's goal.

G> #### Using Vocations
G>
G> Tick-Tock Tarasi has _Clockmaker_ as a vocation.
G>
G> When attempting to shoot a crossbow at an enemy mercenary, she could not fall back on her Clockmaker vocation to improve her chances of success.
G> She could, however, leverage her vocation to improve her chances to pick a lock, assuming she doesn't have a more relevant skill.
G>
G> In cases where she _does_ have a relevant skill, she can choose to use whichever bonus is higher.

G> #### Vocations and Intended Function
G>
G> Vocations are a sort of fall-back option, they should never be the first-choice for a test.
G> Character specialization is described by their _skills_, vocations act as surety that characters don't fail at things in their primary domain.
G>
G> You can do entirely away with skills and just rely on vocations, but be aware that this reduces the number of knobs and levers available.
G>
G> One thing you can do is increase the IP cost of raising a vocation to offset the temptation to use it for everything (if you find that to be a problem).

Every character begins play with a single vocation at 25% and can optionally acquire a second vocation later by spending five IP.
No character can have more than two vocations at a single time.

A> #### Improvement points (IP)
A>
A> Improvement Points, also called IP, are the currency by which your characters advance in Pentola.
A> You gain IP by fulfilling ambitions, protecting dependents, and thwarting enemies.
A> These activities are covered more fully in later chapters.

If you want to trade one of your vocations for another, you can do so freely, though the bonus resets to 25%.

You can write your own vocation, roll to determine your vocation based on the table below, or choose a vocation that you think fits your character.

## Choosing Skills

Skills are things a character specializes in doing.
At the beginning of play, a character has 250 percentage points to spend on skills, where each point grants the character a +1% chance of success to related actions.
In cases where a character has both a vocation _and/or_ one or more skills which could apply to action, use whichever bonus is higher.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Skill and Vocation Bonuses in Action
G>
G> Tick-Tock Tarasi has _Clockmaker_ as a vocation (25% bonus), as well as the skills Crafting (50%), Literacy [Pentolan] (35%), Researching (30%), Alchemy (40%), Occult Lore (30%), Diabolism (20%), Dodge (20%), and Appraisal (20%).
G>
G> Scenrio 1: Shooting a Crossbow
G>
G> None of Tarasi's skills or her vocation apply to this action, so she can't add any bonuses to it.
G>
G> Scenario 2: Picking a Lock
G>
G> In this case, Tarasi has no skills that apply to this action, but her vocation does - so she can add that bonus to this test.
G>
G> Scenario 3: Appraising a Lock
G>
G> In this case, both Tarasi's vocation _and_ her skill Appraisal apply to this action.
G> Her vocation has a higher bonus (25% vs 20%), so she would use her vocation bonus on this test.
G>
G> Scenario 4: Appraising Art
G>
G> In this case, only Tarasi's Appraisal skill applies to this action, so she would add that bonus to this test.

In Pentola there is no defined skill list, but here are a few examples for inspiration:

> Dodge, Archery, Fencing, Culture (Gascon), Alchemy, Athletics, Driving, Bluffing, Persuasion, Rhetoric, Mechanisms, Streetwise, Trade, Literacy (Pentolan), Occult Lore, Medicine, Wrestling, Painting, Swimming, Thaumaturgy, Drakeback Riding, Herbalism, Mathematics, Goldsmithing, Scultping, Researching, Stealth, Haggling, Literacy (Aydinlar), etc.

A> **Archetype Skills**
A>
A> If you're unsure of what sort of character you'd like to play mechanically, you may choose to roll for an archetype on the table below or select one freely.
A>
A> Instead of having 250 points to spend on skills, you gain the skills listed for your archetype and have 50 points left to distribute.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Skills and Ambiguity
G>
G> Note that some of the skills overlap or seem a bit random - it is intended that you pick skills that you want your character to specialize in, then use those specializations to solve problems.
G> The list is freeform so you can capture _exactly_ what makes your character yours.
G>
G> You can determine if a skill is too broad mostly by judgement:
G> Fighting is probably not specific enough, but a particular fighting style is okay.
G> Influence is too broad, but bluff, rhetoric, pursuasion, and bluster are all okay.
G> Largely, if there's a more specific word that can speak to a character's _approach_, rather than their _intent_, it's an indicator that the more specific word should be used.
G> Sometimes, this isn't possible.
G>
G> You can also swing the other way and go for more vague skills that apply more broadly, but be aware that characters will likely accrue a short list of skills with high bonuses.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Passively Using Skills
G>
G> Sometimes you'll want to represent that a character is knowledgeable rather than skilled in a particular action.
G> This does _not_ imply that there are no actions to test for with a given skill!
G> Knowledge of medicine might help you set a bone or identify an illness or determine someone's overall hardiness.
G> Similarly, expertise in wrestling will convey knowledge about things outside of being able to grapple - they'll pick up kinesiology, reading people, etc.
G> Reward characters for specializing!
G>
G> If a character is has a 25% in a skill, consider that they automatically know anything an apprentice in that field might know. For everything else, make them test.
G> If a character has a 50% in a skill, consider that they automatically know anything a seasoned professional in that field might know. For everything else, make them test.
G> If a character has a 75% in a skill, consider that they automatically know anything about their field that isn't hidden, unique, or otherwise very hard to discover. For everything else, make them test.
