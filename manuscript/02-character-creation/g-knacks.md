# Knacks

Knacks are special abilities characters can possess, tied to _who they are_ and _what they repeatedly do_ - a character's knacks are a statement about a character's _gestalt_, the qualities which are more than the sum of a character's individual parts.
Knacks derive from personality traits, behaviors, vocations, and core beliefs.

Characters begin play with a randomly determined knack at magnitude 3.

To determine a new knack, roll a d8 on the formula table and then a d20 four times to determine the quirk, form, effect, and element.
Alternatively, for faster generation, roll a d8 on the formula table and then a d20 once, reading directly across the second table to determine the quirk, form, effect, and element.

If the combination doesn't make sense, roll again or pick an appropriate option from the list.

Some knacks may be predetermined and provided by the referee as resulting from a particular organization, skill, or vocation.

Knacks gained after character creation always start at magnitude 1.
The maximum magnitude of any knack is limited by a character's POW.
For example, a character with a POW of 12 could not have any knacks whose magnitude was 13 or higher.
Note that this limits the maximum magnitude of any given knack, not the total magnitude of knacks a character can acquire.

Once you've determined the description of the knack the referee describes the knack's general effects based on its name and works with you to explain how it ties into your character's gestalt.
If a knack is related to a vocation, skill, or relationship its magnitude can never exceed the 10s place of the relevant bonus (in addition to the limitation on all knacks imposed by your Power score).

G> #### Knacks and Characters
G>
G> Knacks are a way to reinforce both the world and the characters' lives in it.
G> Knacks are an expression of the supersaturation of magic that seeps into every bone, stone, and inch of the land.
G> As characters solidfy in their sense of self and their convictions in the world, the magic _changes_ them.
G> They naturally become more powerful in the things they care about and actualize themselves through.
G>
G> Artisans imbue their work with their magic, gardeners grow potent herbs and incredible flowers, farmers' crops yield more and better, and warriors find that their skills in battle become preternatural.
G>
G> In addition to randomly generated knacks it is a good idea for the referee to grant knacks to characters who seem to be developing along a particular path.
G> This can reinforce the feeling of their actions and beliefs mattering through the mechanics.

If a character exercises a knack against an unwilling target an opposed test is required.
When an opposed test is required, the character exercising their knack always rolls against POW, adding the highest relevant vocation, skill, or relationship bonus if related.
The target rolls against BOD (if the knack is something that can be dodged) or POW (if the knack is something that can be resisted by force of will) and adds their highest relevant bonus as normal.

Unless otherwise specified, a knack's ongoing effects last up to 10 minutes per magnitude and has a range of nearby.
If a knack deals damage instantly it deals 1d6 per magnitude if it is reduced by armor or 2 per magnitude if it is not.
If a knack increases/decreases damage dealt or armor for a duration it does so for 1 point per magnitude.
If a knack imposes a penalty or grants a bonus actively it does so at 10% per magnitude.
If a knack imposes a penalty or grants a bonus passively it does so at 5% per total magnitude.
A knack which grants an extra action or reaction is triggered once in its duration; after the extra actions or reactions are used the knack ends.
If a knack has no mechanical effects which improve with the magnitude, instead grant the character a 10% bonus per magnitude to their opposed POW test to exercise the knack against unwilling targets.

You may also suggest uses for the knack outside of the referee's listed effect.
If the knack fits the description and situation closely the referee should usually allow it.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Example: Creating a Knack
G>
G> To create a knack we first roll a d8 and get a 4.
G> This indicates that the description of our knack will match the following description:
G>
G> > `(Physical Quirk) (Physical Form) of (Physical Effect) (Ethereal Element)`.
G>
G> We now roll a d30 four times to determine each piece: 14, 20, 26, 8.
G>
G> This results in the knack "Polished Nose of Sealing Harmony"
G>
G> The referee interprets this as Karacter's nose appearing to be polished to a smooth shine and, when exercised (and thereby empowered) causes G> those within range who can see them to have their violent and discordant thoughts and tendencies sealed away for the duration.
G>
G> This is linked to Karacter's deeply held belief that problems can be solved by compromise and careful consideration.
G> For every additional point of magnitude this knack will grant a 10% bonus to Karacter's opposed POW test to make this knack affect targets.

## Exercising a Knack

Exercising a knack is an action and takes something out of the character.
To exercise a knack a character spends an amount of power points equal to the magnitude at which they want to exercise the knack.
Characters have some control over how much of themselves they pour into the exercising of a knack and _do not_ have to use their knacks at the highest magnitude.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Example: Exercising a Knack
G>
G> Karacter chooses to exercise their "Polished Nose of Sealing Harmony" knack in response to escalating tensions between two factions.
G> They have the knack at magnitude 5 but choose to exercise it as magnitude 3.
G>
G> Karacter then makes an opposed test against everyone nearby, testing their POW with a +30% bonus from the knack's magnitude.
G> The effected targets also test POW and add the highest relevant bonus, if any.

A character does not need to make any tests to exercise a knack because the ability is an extension of who they are (though an opposed test may need to be made to effect the target as normal).
It uses some metaphysical energy that they experience as a growing sense of hunger and ache in their bones, but does not otherwise tire them.

If a character has no power points to spend on exercising a knack they may instead make a Power test and spend HP equal to the magnitude of the knack they are attempting to exercise.
Note that the HP is lost _whether or not_ they succeed on the test as they burn some of their life force to power the attempt.
Failure indicates that they simply couldn't control it.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Example: Exercising a Knack at 0 PP
G> Karacter chooses to exercise their "Polished Scent of Sealing Harmony" knack in response to escalating tensions between two factions in a last ditch attempt to prevent violence from breaking out.
G> They have the knack at a magnitude 5 and choose to exercise it as such, but have no PP left.
G>
G> Karacter taps into their life force, making a POW test and succeeding; their current HP decreases by 5.
G> They then make an opposed test against everyone nearby, testing their POW with a +50% bonus from the knack's magnitude.
G> The effected targets also test POW and add the highest relevant bonus, if any.
G>
G> **Note:** If Karacter had failed their POW test to exercise the knack they would _still_ have had their current HP decrease by 5.

## Improving Knacks

When spending improvement points you may spend 1IP to increase the magnitude of a knack by 1, provided you meet the prerequisites (if any).
