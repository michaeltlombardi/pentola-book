# Determining Characteristics

Characters in Pentola have three characteristics: Body (BOD), Intellect (INT), and Power (POW).

Body represents a character's physical prowess, including their strength, agility, toughness, hand-eye coordination, etc.
Intellect represents a character's mental prowess, including raw intelligence, cunning, intuition, etc.
Power represent's a character's force of will and (if applicable) metaphysical aptitude (raw magic, psychic aptitude, etc).

You determine your starting characteristics by rolling three six-sided dice (3d6) for each characteristic in order.
You roll first for body, then for intellect, and finally for power.

G> #### Summing 3d6
G>
G> When determining a characteristic you roll 3d6.
G> Assuming you rolled a `6`, a `1`, and a `3`, the sum of these results would be 10.

A 10 in a characteristic is the average for a human - higher scores are above average - and a 20 is the absolute upper bound of a human not affected by special abilities or conditions (magic, cybertech, etc).

G> #### On Starting Characteristics
G>
G> We use the classic 3d6 to determine characteristics for a couple reasons:
G>
G> 1. Homage - this plays into the history of the hobby.
G> 2. A bell curve - this will tend to give results near 10, with few characters who have characteristics either very high or very low.
G>
G> Note that this applies to _humans_, but that other creatures - demons, monsters, etc - can and _should_ have their characteristics determined by a different formula.
G> For example, a minotaur might roll 3d8 for their body and power but only 3d4 for their intellect.
G> Similarly, a stormraven might have a body of 1d4+2, an intellect of 2d6, and a power of 5d6.
G>
G> You could modify this to create more heroic player characters - 2d6+6 will tend to create characters with average characteristics around 13.
G> This isn't the default because Pentola leans into the lethality and danger of combat and magic.

G> #### Determining Characteristics for Karacter
G>
G> To determine Karacter's characteristics, we roll 3d6 each for BOD, INT, and POW:
G>
G> - BOD: 13
G> - INT: 10
G> - POW: 6
G>
G> At the beginning of play Karacter is stronger, tougher, and more agile than most people, has an average mind, and has significantly less personal power than most people.
G>
G> Because the base goal for tests is 3x a characteristic, Karacter's stat block ends up looking like this so far:
G>
G> - BOD: 13 (39%)
G> - INT: 10 (30%)
G> - POW: 6 (18%)

Characteristics give a base goal for tests as 3x the characteristic.

Declare _what_ you're trying to accomplish (your intent) **and** _how_ you intend to accomplish it (your approach).
The referee will determine if your action requires a test and which characteristic is most appropriate.

Then you'll try to roll under the appropriate goal.
Your characteristics determine your base chance of success at any given test, but you'll _usually_ be able to add a bonus from a relevant skill, vocation, or ability.
