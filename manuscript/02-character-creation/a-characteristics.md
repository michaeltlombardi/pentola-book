# Determining Characteristics

Characters in Pentola have three characteristics: Iron, Flax, Bone.

In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more portant when iron is incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it ignores their abilities and defenses.
Iron represent's a character's force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.

Flax is a crop which represents so much of human ingenuity - one of the earliest and most widespread crops domesticated, flax supplies the Pentolans with food, oil, cloth, paper, and paint; it represents ingenuity, industry, trade, craft, and knowledge to the Pentolans.
Flax represents a character's mental prowess and training, including their knowledge and intuition.

Pentolans are not strangers to danger or hard work and associate bone with both, priding themselves on their physical daring and the use of their bodies to accomplish their tasks, though they are ever mindful of their own ultimate fragility.
Bone represents a character's physical prowess and training, including their strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, etc.

Characteristics are the base goal for tests.

Declare _what_ you're trying to accomplish (your intent) **and** _how_ you intend to accomplish it (your approach).
The referee will determine if your action requires a test and which characteristic is most appropriate.

Then you'll try to roll under the appropriate goal.
Your characteristics determine your base chance of success at any given test, but you'll _usually_ be able to add a bonus from a relevant skill, vocation, or ability.

You determine your starting characteristics by rolling three twenty-sided dice (3d20) for each characteristic in order.
You roll first for Bone, then for Flax, and finally for Iron.

G> #### Summing 3d20
G>
G> When determining a characteristic you roll 3d20.
G> Assuming you rolled a `13`, a `7`, and a `16`, the sum of these results would be `36`.

A 30 in a characteristic is the average for a human - higher scores are above average - and a 75 is the absolute upper bound of a human not affected by special abilities or conditions.

G> #### On Starting Characteristics
G>
G> We use 3d20 to determine characteristics for a couple reasons:
G>
G> 1. Homage - this plays into the history of the hobby, where players roll 3d6 to determine their attributes.
G> 2. A bell curve - this will tend to give results near 30, with few characters who have characteristics either very high or very low.
G>
G> Note that this applies to _humans_, but that other creatures - demons, monsters, etc - can and _probably should_ have their characteristics determined by a different formula.
G> For example, a minotaur might roll 7d12 for their body and power but only 3d10 for their intellect.
G> Similarly, a stormraven might have a body of 1d12+12, an intellect of 2d20, and a power of 5d20.
G>
G> You could modify this to create more heroic player characters - 2d20+20 will tend to create characters with average characteristics around 40.
G> This isn't the default because Pentola leans into the lethality and danger of combat and magic.

G> #### Determining Characteristics for Taryn Carozza
G>
G> To determine Taryn's characteristics, we roll 3d20 each for Iron, Flax, and Bone:
G>
G> - **Iron**: 18 -- basic
G> - **Flax**: 44 -- comprehensive
G> - **Bone**: 51 -- _extraordinary_!
G>
G> At the beginning of play Taryn has significantly less personal power than most people, has an average education and knowledge-base, and is stronger, tougher, and more agile than most people.
