# Improving Characters

Characters begin play with five improvement points.
You may choose to spend them immediately or hang onto them until later.

Characters in Pentola advance in a few ways:

1. By using their skills, characters have a chance to improve those skills.
1. By acting in the world, characters may improve or lose their reputations.
1. By interacting with the people and groups with whom they have relationships, those relationships grow stronger or weaker and new ones may form.
1. By spending improvement points gained by achieving ambitions or by spending long periods of time practicing and researching, characters can improve themselves.

## Gaining IP via Practice or Research

During downtime between adventures the players may improve their characters.
For every three month period of dedicated practice or research a character may gain 1IP.

## Improving Skills Through Use

Once per adventure when a character makes a normal or harder test and uses a relevant skill bonus, make a mark beside that skill.
At the end of each adventure, roll a d100 for each skill you marked during play.
If the result of the roll is higher than the skill bonus, you have improved it - in this case, increase the bonus by 3.
If the result is lower, the character has not learned enough to improve.

**Every time** you fumble a test using a skill, roll 1d4 and add that result to the skill bonus.
This represent a character gleaning new understanding from failure.

There is no limit to the bonus a skill can reach.

## Gaining and Losing Reputation

Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed and could reinforce a character's reputation, make a mark to the right of the reputation on your character sheet.
Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed anc could degrade a character's reputation, make a mark to the left of the reputation on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's reputations - one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a d100 for each remaining mark.
If the mark is to the right of the reputation and the result is higher than the reputation bonus, increase it by 3.
If the mark is to the left of the reputation and the result is lower than the reputation bonus, decrease it by 3.

## Changing Relationships

Every time a character fulfills an obligation or grants a favor to an ally, dependent or organization, thwarts an enemy or is thwarted by them, make a mark to the right of the relationship on your character sheet.
Every time a character fails an ally, dependent, or organization, or ignores an enemy threat, make a mark to the left of the relationship on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's relationships - one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a d100 for each remaining mark.
If the mark is to the right of the relationship and the result is higher than the relationship bonus, increase it by 3.
If the mark is to the left of the relationship and the result is lower than the relationship bonus, decrease it by 3.

## Spending Improvement points
