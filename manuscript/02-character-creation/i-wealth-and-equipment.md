# Wealth and Equipment

In Pentola, wealth is abstracted and represented by a [usage die]().
Characters are assumed to start with a default wealth of _average_ (a d8 usage die).
You can, instead, opt to bein play with three additional improvement points per wealth level you forego.

| IP Cost |    Level   |        Social Class        | Usage Die |Equipment Examples |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------:|:------------------|
|    1    | Destitute  | Beggars                    | **d4**    | A glass of wine
|    4    | Poor       | Free laborers              | **d6**    | Pound of salt pork
|    7    | Average    | Tradesfolk                 | **d8**    | Tool
|    11   | Prosperous | Minor merchants, officials | **d10**   | Fine Wine bottle
|    15   | Wealthy    | Merchants, minor nobility  | **d12**   | War horse
|    20   | Rich       | Spirons, Guildheads        | **d20**   | Building

Whenever you make a sizable purchase, including buying additional starting equipment, you must roll your usage die at least once (more expensive items require more rolls).
On a roll of a 1, your usage die decreases in size as normal.
Note that if your usage die decreases due to a purchase and you're making multiple rolls, the remaining rolls are made with the new usage die.
Once your usage die has been fully expended, your wealth drops by one rank and you gain a new usage die appropriate to your new wealth.
If you're destitute and your usage die reduces you cannot make any more purchases until you recover resources.

Whenever you make a sizable sale, roll your usage die (as with purchases, more valuable items require multiple rolls).
If the result of the roll is the maximum for that die your usage die increases one step in size, up to the maximum for that wealth level.
If your usage die increases due to a purchase the remaining rolls are made with the new usage die.

G> #### Abstract Wealth and Economy
G>
G> Economic concerns in Pentola are abstracted away, but not entirely.
G> The goal is to provide _some_ resource management without making it over-burdensome.
G> It also introduces risk and tension to every purchase and sale that a character makes - the hope being that players will pay more attention to their equipment list and try to use it more creatively.
G>
G> You can swap out the abstraction for something more familiar, like gold/silver/copper, but be mindful that this will require some fiddling.
G> Guidelines for items converted from other systems:
G>
G> - Every 100 silver pieces in Runequest is roughly equal to a wealth roll.
G> - Every 10 gold pieces in an OSR game is roughly equal to a wealth roll.
G> - Every 25 gold pieces in a newer edition is roughly equal to a wealth roll.
G>
G> This begins to break down when you get to very expensive items like plate armor, ships, horses (drakes in Pentola, there's no horses!), and most magic items.
G> Consider making acquiring these items more akin to a side quest to convince the seller to make a deal or acquire the funds.
G> Also keep in mind that most other systems are lower-magic than Pentola - one option is to drop the cost of magic items to 1/10th.
G>
G> Also be mindful that it's _okay_ for some things to be beyond the reach of relatively new characters and to give more experienced characters access to better equipment by grant from their organization, by recovering them from catacombs, or by outright stealing them.
G> Each of these options can turn equipment acquisition into a more interesting, impactful part of the campaign.

Later, when improving your character, you can spend a number of improvement points equal to the difference between your current wealth and the desired rank.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Improving Wealth
G>
G> Karacter started play with Average wealth and wants to increase it to Well-Off.
G>
G> The difference in IP costs is 11 - 7, so Karacter would pay 4 IP to increase their wealth.
G>
G> If Karacter wanted to instead increase their wealth from Average to Wealthy, they would pay 8 IP.

## Encumbrance

A character can carry a number of items equal to their BOD with no issues.
Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered and all tests are one step harder - they can also only ever move to somewhere nearby in a moment.
They simply cannot carry more than double their BOD.

Note that some items can increase your encumbrance maximum by making carrying items easier.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Encumbrance and Large or Small Items
G>
G> Sometimes, it seems obvious that an object shouldn't take up a slot for each instance of that item - arrows, scrolls, daggers, etc - in these cases, either make a judgement call (if encumbrance is important to you) and say every 5 or 20 of an item counts as a slot, or make players use something like a scroll case or quiver and count that.
G> Alternatively, consider just having each unique type of item be a slot.
G> One tradeoff you can let the players make is allowing them to store their items in containers on their person, but make it take a moment to retrieve items from those containers.
G>
G> Similarly, some items are overly bulky, awkward, or heavy - it might make sense for them to count as two or even three slots.
G>
G> As with most things in Pentola, referees are empowered to make judgements that will fit their table.

## Armor

Armor provides protection (AP) by reducing all incoming damage.
When taking damage from an attack reduce the incoming damage by the AP.
However, heavier armors impose penalties, making some tests one step harder.

Armors also have a usage die which must be rolled after every combat in which damage was taken that the armor did not completely absorb.
Damaged armor can be repaired unless its usage die is completely used up, in which case it is damaged beyond repair.
Each step up in usage die costs a wealth roll unless the armor has the expensive or cheap qualities.

When purchasing armor, roll your wealth usage die once for each AP the armor provides, unless it has the cheap or expensive qualities.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Armor In Play
G>
G> Karacter started play with a padded shirt (AP 1, d6 usage die, cheap).
G> Their total AP is 1 - unless an enemy makes a called strike to un unprotected area, all incoming physical damage will be reduced by 1 automatically.
G> After a fight where they were hurt, Karacter must roll for their armor to see if it has been damaged.
G> They roll a 1 and the usage die reduces to a d4.
G>
G> Karacter can take their padded shirt to be repaired (one wealth roll) or attempt to repair it themself.
G>
G> Later, Karacter acquires a plated cap (AP 1, d8 usage die) and decides to wear it, increasing their AP to 2.

### Types of Armor

- **Shirt:** Shirts of armor cover your torso and upper arms, falling to just about your hips.
- **Skirt:** Skirts of armor cover your waist and upper legs, stopping at around the knees.
- **Vambraces:** Vambraces cover your forearms.
- **Helm:** Helms come in two broad categories, open and closed.
  Open helms cover the top of your head, the back, and your cheeks.
  Closed helms cover your whole head but at a cost of making it harder to hear and see.
  Most closed helms have an option to open them up, allowing you to improve protection for combat without spending all day hard of hearing.
  Both types of helm include neck flaps to protect the back of the neck.
- **Cap:** Caps cover the top of your head and do not do much to protect the sides or back.
- **Breastplate:** Breastplates cover the front and back of your torso as well as the tops of your shoulders.
- **Hauberk:** Hauberks cover your chest, arms, and upper thighs as a sort of very large shirt.
- **Trews:** Trews cover your legs.
- **Greaves:** Greaves cover your calves.

{icon=wrench}
G> ##### Additional Types of Armor
G>
G> There's dozens of other ways to break down armor into smaller pieces - feel free to provide alternate types of armor wherever you want, just be mindful of total AP and cost.
G> The list above isn't comprehensive, but it's about as many useful distinctions as we felt could be added without pushing choice paralysis on players.

### Armor Materials

- **Bone:** In Pentola, armor made of strips of hard bone sewn to drakeleather backing are common and reasonably affordable for common soldiers.
  Bone armor is made from drakebone, from whalebone, and from imported sources such as horse.
- **Enamelled:** Wealthy folks in Pentola with a flair for fashion will often purchase enamelled armor made of drakeleather and treated with lacquer and alchemical reagents to stiffen the armor and make it amenable to extensive decoration.
  Most enamelled armor is worn over padded shirt and trews and is made bespoke for the owner.
- **Padded:** Padded armor is made of many layers of cloth stiffened in water from the canals to provide cheap but reasonable protection from edged weapons.
- **Plate:** Shaped plated of bronze provide superior protection for the wearer at the cost of weight and high value.
  Polished to a shine and often tooled with decoration, plate armor is the pinacle of armor for professional warriors and marines.
  It's resistant to water and relatively easy to repair, compared to enamelled armor, though less fashion-forward.
  It is normally worn over padded shirt and trews to provide some coverage for the gaps in the armor.
  Suits of bronze armor are expensive, especially if bespoke, though more generic pieces are available due to demand from military forces.
- **Scale:** Armor made of small overlapping bronze plates sewn to drakeleather provides very good protection and is relatively affordable.
  It requires both more and less maintenance as individual scales can be replaced if damaged.
  It's cheaper than plate or enamelled armor because it can be produced in a few sizes to accommodate numerous bodies.
  It's therefore also easier to loot from an enemy.
- **Linen:** Linen armor is made of layers of glued linen formed into bands and sewn together to provide cheap, reasonable armor for common soldiers and folks who fight mostly on land.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Tweaking Armor Materials
G>
G> Pentola assumes a high-magic bronze age urban center full of artisans and dozens of cultures mashing up together to create a metropolis.
G> There's no reason characters couldn't come across armor materials considered exotic for Pentola - sharkskin, griffin wool, etc.
G> Be mindful that there's no indigenous domesticated mammals in the city and surrounding areas - no cows, sheep, pigs, or horses - so normal leather is a luxury good imported from elsewhere.
G> Highlight items made from those materials as higher status or remarkable, because Pentolans would think of them that way.
G>
G> Particularly notable here, as with the rest of the setting, is the relative scarcity of iron.
G> Iron is mostly used for it's anti-demon properties - this world does not have steel manufacture but does have plentiful sources of copper and tin for bronze.
G> In Pentola, adding iron to armor and other equipment is incredibly expensive and often is more valuable as a component for magic and anti-demon applications.

### Armor Qualities

- **Expensive:** Armor with this quality must be made to order and requires an additional wealth roll to purchase and repair.
- **Cheap:** Armor with this quality never requires more than a single wealth roll to purchase but also never nets more than a single wealth roll when sold.
- **Easily Repairable:** Armor with this quality is easier and cheaper to repair; roll twice on the usage die when repairing it yourself or make only one wealth roll to have it repaired to full if being done professionally.
- **Fashionable:** Armor with this quality makes relevant social tests one step easier - people perceive the wearer as more wealthy and high status.
- **Heavy:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes athletics-related actions and to resist fatigue one step harder.
- **Loud:**  Wearing any armor with this quality makes stealth-related actions where being heard is a concern one step harder.
- **Dampened Hearing:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes tests to notice something audible one step harder.
- **Limited Vision:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes visual perception tests one step harder.

### Masterwork and Magic Armor

In Pentola, because magic is supersaturating the world and everything (and everyone!) in it, masterfully crafted items _are_ magical.
There is no distinction.

Particularly well crafted items by artisans might add or remove qualities from an item, increase the AP or usage die, or provide interesting and unique abilities.
These items require an additional wealth roll for each step of improvement over the base item.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Examples of Magic Armor
G>
G> Here a few examples of magical armor created by artisans:
G>
G> - Enamelled Vambraces of the Sphinx: AP 1, d8, Fashionable, Expensive (three wealth rolls).
G>   These vambraces have imagery of a spinx (a mythical creature from the Aydinlar empire) emblazoned on them in gold and brown.
G>   In addition to their normal qualities, these vambraces grant the wearer particular skill at solving riddles.
G> - Lion Bone Helm: AP 1, d8, Dampened Hearing, Fashionable, (four wealth rolls).
G>   This impressive helm made from the skull of a massive feline creature amplifies the wearers voice, making tests to be heard and to intimidate one step easier.
G> - Padded Thinking Cap: AP 2, d6 (four wealth rolls).
G>   This cap is made of woven silk and the weave itself is an homage to Archives, showing small scrolls and quills.
G>   It grants the wearer +1 to their Intellect while worn.
G> - Grave Greaves: AP 1, d10, Expensive (three wealth rolls).
G>   These bronze plate greaves have been molded into the shape of catacomb walls and no amount of polishing will clear the verdigris from them.
G>   They make opposed power tests to resist hostile actions one step easier.
G> - Exploding Scale Hauberk: AP 3, d12, Heavy, (6 wealth rolls).
G>   Every scale of this hauberk has been delicately inscribed with a rune of ejection.
G>   The wearer can will this hauberk to violently shed scales in a burst centered on them at a magnitude of 1 per usage die step they are willing to sacrifice.
G>   For each magnitude spent the scales deal 3 damage which may be reduced by armor.
G> - Artisanal Linen Skirt: AP 2, d8 (three wealth rolls).
G>   This bands of this linen skirt detail an idyllic scene of peace in a spire garden.

## Weapons and Shields

Weapons and shields have a damage die which is rolled to determine how much HP damage is inflicted on the target.
Remember that AP and parrying can reduce incoming damage to zero.

In addition to damage, weapons and shields also have a usage die.
For weapons, the usage die is rolled after every combat where the weapon fails to damage an enemy because all of the damage was negated by AP or the weapon was used to parry an attack.

You can use your shield to block an incoming attack, reducing the usage die by one step to negate all incoming damage if you succeed on the opposed test.

The cost of a weapon is determined by its usage die and damage:

A weapon or shield with a usage die of a d4 requires 1 wealth, a d6 requires 2 wealth rolls, and so on.
A weapon or shield which has one damage die (1d4, 1d6, etc) requires 1 wealth roll, a weapon with 2 damage dice requires 2 wealth rolls, and so on.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Weapons and Pricing
G>
G> The default rules here make weapons much more costly and valuable, especially when compared to other games.
G> This is because weapons are not normally acquired by general citizens - characters in Pentola tend to get involved in all sorts of trouble and adventures that most citizens try very hard to avoid.
G> Weapons also make for pretty good treasure and can be traded for other equipment because of their expense.
G>
G> You could make acquiring weapons cheaper by removing the usage die cost, but be mindful that weapons are some of the most plentiful items the characters will be looting.

### Weapon Qualities

- **Cheap:** Weapons with this quality never requires more than a single wealth roll to purchase but also never nets more than a single wealth roll when sold.
- **Concealable:** Weapons with this quality are easy to conceal and can be hidden in your clothes and armor.
- **Heavy:** Weapons with this quality count twice for encumbrance.
- **Reach:** Weapons with this quality are longer than most, allowing you to keep an opponent at a distance, meaning they'll have to successfully close with you in order to use their weapon.
- **Balanced:** Weapons with this quality are designed to be thrown and may be used against nearby targets in addition to close ones.
- **Ranged:** Weapons with this quality are designed to shoot ammunition at an enemy who is distant or closer.
  You can also shoot at enemies who are Far Away, but the test is one step harder.
  You can parry a melee attack with a ranged weapon but its usage die automatically decreases by one.
- **Expensive:** Weapons with this quality require an additional wealth roll to purchase and repair.
- **Easily Repairable:** Armor with this quality is easier and cheaper to repair; roll twice on the usage die when repairing it yourself or make only one wealth roll to have it repaired to full if being done professionally.
- **Slow (X):** Weapons with this quality are slow to reload and require X actions to reload.
- **Fashionable:** Weapons with this quality makes relevant social tests one step easier - people perceive the wearer as more wealthy and high status.

| Weapon              | Usage Die | Damage | Qualities |

### Masterwork and Magic Weapons

As with armor there's no distinction between masterwork weapons and magical ones.

Particularly skilled artisans might create items which are more resilient, deal more damage, add or remove qualities, or grant new special abilities.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Examples of Magic Armor
G>
G> Here a few examples of magical armor created by artisans:
G>
G> - **Spireblade:** d12 usage, 2d4 damage, Fashionable (7 wealth rolls).
G>   This elegant bronze blade has been lovingly crafted by a spire artisan and has the Spire's name engraved into it.
G>   The handle is wrapped in sharksin and the pommel is polished crystal which glows ever so slightly.
G> - **Mageglass Dagger:** d8 usage, 1d6 damage, Expensive (6 wealth rolls).
G>   This blackglass dagger is born of stone from the heart of a volcano, the handle wrapped in silver silk.
G>   It functions as a dagger against most opponents, but against demons it deals triple damage.
G> - **Storm Spear:** d8 usage, 1d12 damage (5 wealth rolls).
G>   This spear's shaft is made from a dark hardwood, the head of the spear gleams in the light and the whole thing vibrates slightly during stormy weather.
G>   When thrown the spear becomes a bolt of lightning dealing 2d8 damage and returning to the wielder's hand at the beginning of the next moment but the usage die automatically decreases one step.
G> - **Mirror Shield:** d12 usage, 1d6 damage (7 wealth rolls).
G>   This round shield is polished to a literal mirror sheen and has small runes inscribed around the edges in a tiny iron rim.
G>   In addition to blocking normal attacks, this shield can be used to reflect magic attacks back at an enemy.
G>   When using the shield this way, reduce the usage die by one step as if blocking an attack.
G> - **Sniper Sling:** 2d8 (three wealth rolls).
G>   This sling is innocuous except for the black stitching weaving through it.
G>   This sling may be used against any enemy who can be seen, no matter the range.
G> - **Majestic Trout:** 1d8 usage, 2d6 damage (6 wealth rolls).
G>   This solid bronze statue of a trout with its mouth agape flops in the hand, acting as something akin to a flail.
G>   Attacks with the majestic trout cannot be parried, only blocked or dodged.

## Starting Equipment

To speed up character creation, characters all begin with a set of starting equipment.
They may, optionally, buy additional equipment from the lists above or seek additional equipment.
If you rolled for or chose an archetype in the skills section you will probably want to select the equipment package that matches it here.

| d10 result |    Archetype    | Starting Equipment |
|:----------:|:---------------:|:-------------------|
|      1     | Sword and Board | Linen Shirt, Linen Skirt, Sword, Buckler, Dagger, Small Sack, Backpack, Lantern, Flask of Oil, Wineskin

G> #### Example: Determining Wealth and Buying Equipment for Karacter
G>
G> We decide to have Karacter forego one level of wealth and begin play as Poor to gain an addition three improvement points immediately.
G>
G> This means picking up any additional starting equipment is going to be a bit dicey.
G>
G> We chose Knight for Karacter's archetype earlier, so we'll just use that equipment to start.
G>
G> That nets us some good armor, a sword and shield, a lance, a dagger, and equipment for drakeriding.
G>
G> To round out Karacter though, we want to pick up a lantern and two flasks of oil - it'd be nice to grab a bow and some arrows, but starting with a wealth of Poor, that's pretty risky.
G>
G> We roll against Karacter's wealth (a d6) for each item in order:
G>
G> - For the lantern we roll a 6 and suffer no substantial loss in funds.
G> - For the first flask of oil we roll a 2.
G> - For the second flask, however, we roll a 1 - reducing our wealth die to a d4!
G>   If Karacter buys anything else and rolls a 1, they'll become Destitute!
G>
G> Looks like Karacter _definitely_ isn't going to be starting with a bow!
