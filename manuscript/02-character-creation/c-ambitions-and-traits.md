# Determining Traits and Ambitions

The following sections give you a bit of background you can use to make your character more distinctive and which you can build on to have a starting point.

As with all of the other character creation tables, you are _not obligated_ to use them!
You can roll on them, choose from them, make up traits of your own, or otherwise start play with something more of a blank slate.

You must, however, start play with one long term ambition.

Long term ambitions are things that are a character's motivation in life, only achievable over multiple adventures.
Short term ambitions are usually relevant to the adventure currently being played and are determined near the beginning of each session.
Short term ambitions are removed from the character sheet at the end of each session.
Ambitions are always removed from the character sheet when completed.

Achieving ambitions earns your character Improvement Points (IP), which you can spend to improve your character:

- Once per session per ambition, when that ambition is brought into play in a concrete way, the character earns 1IP.
- If a short term ambition is achieved the character earns 2IP.
- If a long term ambition is achieved the character earns 5IP.

Mark your character's long term ambition on your character sheet.
A character may record up to two long term ambitions and one short term ambition on their character sheet at a time - you may pursue other ambitions, but they will not earn improvement points.

G> #### Ambitions and IP
G>
G> The accrual of IP by working to fulfill ambitions is an important mechanic in Pentola.
G> It emphasizes that characters grow by pursuing their own goals in the world, a reflection of the effect of magic upon them.
G> As their ambitions are realized, their gestalt grows stronger and more defined.
G>
G> Note that characters accrue IP for working to fulfill their ambitions, not only for completing them.

G> #### Example: Determining Traits and Ambitions for Karacter
G>
G> For Karacter we roll once for each column in the traits table:
G>
G> - **Personality:** Contradictory (21)
G> - **Physical Trait:** Narrow Eyes (56)
G> - **Interest:** Learning (58)
G> - **Fear:** Drakes (33)
G> - **Long Term Ambition:** Ward Off Demonic Threat Through Song (90)
G>
G> These traits paint an image of Karacter as a person eager to learn and always watchful, seeking truth by speaking up even when it's unwise.
G> Their fear of Drakes makes their start as a would-be Knight more difficult _and_ interesting.
G> The ambition to ward off Demons with a song implies that they have a curiosity about the _Gondolieri_ who are famous for abjuring the demons in the canals with their songs.
