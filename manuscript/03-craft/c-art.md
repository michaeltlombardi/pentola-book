# Art and the Craft

In Pentola, the overlap of artistic endeavors and the Craft itself is so large as to make the distinction largely meaningless.
While alchemist's toil in their laboratories and crafters pour over books and symbols, artists design in their studios, using their knowledge and skill to bring about effects in the world via the creation of _opuses_.
Of the three approaches to the Craft, the arts are the most flexible and personal.

When crafters apply dweomers through their art - physical (sculptures, paintings, architecture, etc) and ethereal (songs, poems, dances, etc.) - they are actualizing an opus which acts as a separately applied dweomer.
If the opus can be experienced without the artist actively participating, it is _physical_; otherwise it is _ethereal_.

Most artists who practice the craft research unique dweomers, either on their own or as an apprentice.

When researching and actualizing opuses, artisans use their specific art rating instead of Crafting for both their tests and determining maximum complexity.
Note that this means an artisan may be able to create more complex opuses with one type of art than another.

Except as noted below, actualizing opuses follows the same rules and steps as ritually applying dweomers.

## Physical Opuses

Actualizing a physical opus requires gathering appropriate materials at a cost of 1V per 5 points of complexity and spending 1 hour per point of complexity working on it.
The time is reduced by the opus' rank:

- 30 minutes per point of complexity for an comprehensively known opus
- 15 minutes per point of complexity for an extraordinarily known opus
- 10 minutes per point of complexity for an incredibly known opus
- 1 minute per point of complexity for an unbelievably known opus

No additional Crafting test is needed to trigger the effect - the creation is, itself, a dweomer.

Once actualized, the art is empowered with the dweomers' effects until the duration ends.
Physical opuses may also have a specific trigger (someone coming Close to it, or speaking in front of it, or being in love, etc), in which case the duration's clock does not start until triggered.

Actualizing a physical opus requires spending 1 value per 5 points of complexity (minimum 1) to acquire appropriate materials.

G>
G> It is likely that most characters will tend towards physical art because it allows you to save up one or more effects for later use.
G> Physical art with triggers is particularly useful in this regard.
G>
G> It might be tempting to provide counters for this flexibility and utility, but you should not.
G> Much of Pentola's balance and feel depends on rewarding clever play and preparation by players and characters.
G> Players remember negating challenges by clever play much more fondly than they do being nullified for the referee's convenience.

### Researching a Physical Opus

Researching a physical opus follows the same rules as researching a dweomer, except that:

- you must also spend value equal to the materials needed for your experiment (paints, marble, bronze, whatever), minimum 1V
- each created opus with a roll of 2-3 has some slight, but fading effect related to your research goal
- each created opus with a roll of 1 has an unexpected or backfiring effect compared to your research goal

### Physical Opuses as Magic Items

It is also possible for a crafter to make an item whose effects are specific and permanent -- e.g. a pair of greaves which can be activated daily, or headscarf which dyes the wearer's hair a particular shade if worn overnight, etc -- in these cases, the creation of the item for the first time follows the same rules as researching a dweomer, as the manipulations are fixed to an exact degree.

Afterwards, a crafter can create a copy of a magic item they have already created as if making physical art as normal.

## Ethereal Opuses

G> #### On Gondolieri Dweomersongs
G>
G> While our own people have produced many incredible artists in whose work the magic is undeniable, no peoples pursue the twinning of craft and art as seriously and prolifically as the Pentolans.
G>
G> The most noticeable pursuers of this art are the gondolieri, the folk who guard and guide travelers of the canal in their gondolas.
G> The gondolieri are heard long before they are seen, singing dweomersongs of their own making which ward off demons and provide other effects.
G>
G> Aside from a few traditional songs, no Gondolieri would be caught dead singing the song of another.
G> It is a point of great pride and competition between them to invent ever more complex and powerful songs.
G> This uniqueness has another purpose though - it seems that while their songs ward off the monstrous denizens of the canals, any two gondolieri singing the same song will serve to _summon_ those creatures, not ward them off.
G>
G> In any case, after spending several years amongst these peoples I can say one thing with certain:
G> It is only the singing of the gondolieri which makes traveling their city any kind of joy, assuming you can stand their fanciful experiments with the human voice.

Actualizing an ethereal opus takes 1 minute per point of complexity to perform instead of the normal time.
It takes effect either at completion (starting the duration clock), or begins immediately but lasts only for so long as the performance does.

Actualizing an ethereal opus spends 1PP for every 5 points of complexity.
This cost can be spent from charms or other sources as normal.

G> #### Ethereal Art and Society
G>
G> While ethereal performances may not always be useful while adventuring - enemies will rarely wait around while you recite a poem - they are particularly useful in intrigue and social situations.
G>
G> It's also a good idea to encourage characters to think up other ethereal performance ideas - battle dances, warsongs, music played with their armor, etc.
G> It can make the game feel more distinct and strange, a feeling Pentola was written to lean into.

### Creating an Ethereal Opus

Creating an ethereal opus follows the same rules as researching a dweomer, except that:

- you must also expend all of your PP in the attempt as the process is intense and draws directly from your every reserve
- each created opus with a roll of 2-3 has some slight, but fading effect related to your research goal
- each created opus with a roll of 1 has an unexpected or backfiring effect compared to your research goal
