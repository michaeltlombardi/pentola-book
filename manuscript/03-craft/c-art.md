# Art and the Craft

In Pentola, the overlap of artistic endeavors and the Craft itself is so large as to make the distinction largely meaningless.
While alchemist's toil in their laboratories and crafters pour over books and symbols, artists design in their studios, using their knowledge and skill to bring about effects in the world.
Of the three approaches to the Craft, the arts are the most flexible and personal.

When crafters apply dweomers through their art - physical (sculptures, paintings, architecture, etc) and ethereal (songs, poems, dances, etc.) - each piece of art acts as a separately applied dweomer.
If the work of art can be experienced without the artist actively participating, it is _physical_; otherwise it is _ethereal_.

Most artists who practice the craft research unique dweomers, either on their own or as an apprentice.
When researching a dweomer and performing experiments, an artist may learn the dweomer and how to apply it via their chosen art.

While maximum complexity of any dweomer is still governed by their Crafting skill bonus, Crafters may choose to apply dweomers using their art skill bonus instead.

Except as noted below, applying dweomers through art follows the same rules and steps as ritually applying dweomers.

## Physical Art Dweomers

Applying a dweomer as physical art requires 1 hour per point of complexity to actualize instead of the normal time.
No additional Crafting test is needed to trigger the effect - the creation is, itself, a dweomer.

Once actualized, the art is empowered with the dweomers' effects until the duration ends.

Dweomers applied as physical art may also have a specific trigger (someone coming Close to it, or speaking in front of it, or being in love, etc), in which case the duration's clock does not start until triggered.

Applying a dweomer as physical art requires a wealth test for every 5 points of complexity to acquire appropriate materials.

G> #### Physical Art and Preparedness
G>
G> It is likely that most characters will tend towards physical art because it allows you to save up one or more effects for later use.
G> Physical art with triggers is particularly useful in this regard.
G>
G> It might be tempting to provide counters for this flexibility and utility, but you should not.
G> Much of Pentola's balance and feel depends on rewarding clever play and preparation by players and characters.
G> Players remember negating challenges by clever play much more fondly than they do being nullified for the referee's convenience.

## Ethereal Art Dweomers

G> While our own people have produced many incredible artists in whose work the magic is undeniable, no peoples pursue the twinning of craft and art as seriously and prolifically as the Pentolans.
G>
G> The most noticeable pursuers of this art are the gondolieri, the folk who guard and guide travelers of the canal in their gondolas.
G> The gondolieri are heard long before they are seen, singing dweomersongs of their own making which ward off demons and provide other effects.
G>
G> Aside from a few traditional songs, no Gondolieri would be caught dead singing the song of another.
G> It is a point of great pride and competition between them to invent ever more complex and powerful songs.
G> This uniqueness has another purpose though - it seems that while their songs ward off the monstrous denizens of the canals, any two gondolieri singing the same song will serve to _summon_ those creatures, not ward them off.
G>
G> In any case, after spending several years amongst these peoples I can say one thing with certain:
G> It is only the singing of the gondolieri which makes traveling their city any kind of joy, assuming you can stand their fanciful experiments with the human voice.

Applying a dweomer as ethereal art takes either 1 minute per point of complexity to perform instead of the normal time. and takes effect at completion, when the duration clock starts or has an effect which begins immediately but lasts only for so long as the performance does.

Performing a dweomer as ethereal art spends 1PP for every 5 points of complexity.

G> #### Ethereal Art and Society
G>
G> While ethereal performances may not always be useful while adventuring - enemies will rarely wait around while you recite a poem - they are particularly useful in intrigue and social situations.
G>
G> It's also a good idea to encourage characters to think up other ethereal performance ideas - battle dances, warsongs, music played with their armor, etc.
G> It can make the game feel more distinct and strange, a feeling Pentola was written to lean into.
