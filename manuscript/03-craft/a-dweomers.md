# Dweomers

The traits used by dweomers are detailed below.

- **Concentration:** The dweomer's effects will remain in place as long as the character concentrates on it, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
  Concentrating on a dweomer is functionally identical to applying the dweomer, requiring the Crafter to continue to gesture with both arms, chant and ignore distractions.
- **Instant:** The dweomer's effects take place instantly, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
  The dweomer itself then disappears.
- **Permanent:** The dweomer's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
- **Resist:** The dweomer's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make an opposed POW test in order to avoid the effect of the dweomer entirely.
- **Dodge:** The dweomer's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make an opposed test (their BOD vs the crafter's POW) in order to avoid the effect of the dweomer entirely.
  Note that the target must be able to use their reaction in order to dodge.
  In the case of area dweomers, the Dodge trait requires the target to dive in order to mitigate the dweomer's effect.
- **Touch:** Touch dweomers require the character to actually touch his target for the dweomer to take effect, instead of the range being determined via manipulation.
  The crafter must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire application of the dweomer.

## Formulaic Dweomers

There is a long, long list of known dweomers whose application is known as a formula, repeatable and recognizable no matter the crafter applying it.

When creating a new character, roll once on the following table per full 10% bonus you have in the Crafting skill (or pick from the list).

Note that many dweomers have two opposite uses (such as _Holdfast / Repel_): if a crafter learns this dweomer they can choose which of the two ways they wish to apply it _at_ application.

Some dweomers have a word in parentheses, like _Illusory (Sense)_.
These dweomers are a single entry for numerous, related dweomers, one for each possible value for the word in parentheses.
In the case of _Illusory Sense_, there's a series of dweomers, each of which the crafter would need to learn separately:

- Illusory Sight
- Illusory Smell
- Illusory Taste
- Illusory Touch
- Illusory Sound

Use your best judgement for which values fit a particular dweomer (referr has final say).

G> #### Creative Uses
G>
G> In addition the stated description it is _strongly encouraged_ that you use dweomers in varied and creative ways.
G> Very few formulaic dweomers directly cause damage to targets but almost any dweomer can be used offensively or creatively while adventuring.
G>
G> If there's an effect which makes sense given the dweomer's description the referee should err on the side of allowing for creative solutions and uses and adjudicate as neccessary.

## Secret Dweomers

There are hundreds more dweomers known to the denizens of Pentola, and thousands more besides - but most of those dweomers are known only to a select few who guard their knowledge jealously, teaching only those they trust - or those who pay a high enough price.
In Pentola, belonging to a specific organization at a high enough level sometimes grants you access to specific dweomers, or apprenticing to another Crafter.

Like the formulaic dweomers above, these can be learned from books and teachings and passed down to future Crafters.
Secret dweomers can even be researched, creating wholly new dweomers or recreating the effects of ones only observed.
Secret dweomers are otherwise just like formulaic dweomers in every meaningful way.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Secret Dweomers and Organizations
G>
G> Part of the purpose of keeping the list of dweomers in this section small is to emphasize that every organization has different needs and focuses - and so they research and teach particular dweomers.
G>
G> Magic in Pentola is vast and varied, and there should be dozens of spells unique to a particular Crafter or organization.
G> The common dweomers are the sort of thing that shouldn't be surprising or particularly wondrous to behold - the strange and surprising dweomers should be researched and taught - and therefore known - by a smaller number of people.

## Researching Dweomers

Researching dweomers covers two related activities: trying to learn and replicate formulaic or secret dweomers and trying to solve for and define dweomers with new effects.

In either case, these activities involve experimentation, reading, and extensive math and metaphysical thinking.

Each dweomer researched requires making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A full day's worth of work to prepare and attempt without distractions
1. A wealth test for related items and safety protocols
1. A successful crafting test
   - The test is one step harder if being researched without notes or materials defining the dweomer.
   - The test is one step easier if being aided by someone else who knows the dweomer.

After each successful experiment, roll a d4: on a result of a 4, the dweomer is successfully learned.
On a result of a 1 an entirely new experiment must be devised.
On a result of a 2-3 the same experiment may be repeated with the difficulty one step easier.

{icon=dice-d20}
G> #### Example: Researching a Dweomer
G>
G> Karacter wants to learn how to apply a dweomer they saw referenced once in the biography of a mage - the effect was described as "filling the room with thunder and shaking the very stones apart with voice alone."
G>
G> Between the player and referee, the effect is determined to be the infliction of 2M damage caused by sonic waves from the crafter and which has a 10% chance per M to destroy solid objects which it comes in contact with.
G>
G> Karacter aquires chalk, pen, ink, and other materials for the experiment, making a wealth test for the lot.
G> They then spend two half-days preparing for the experiment (Karacter has work, they can't just skip it to learn a dweomer).
G> Finally, Karacter is ready to try the experiment and makes a hard Crafting test and succeeds.
G> Karacter rolls a d4 with a result of a 2 - though they didn't learn everything they needed to from the experiment, Karacter can repeat it after another day's preparation without it being a hard test.
G>
G> Two days later, Karacter tries again and succeeds in the experiment, rolling a d4 and getting a 4!
G> Karacter has successfully learned _Thunderspeech_, a new dweomer which allows Karacter to project their voice to destroy obstacles and injure enemies.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Researching and Balance
G>
G> When creating new dweomers, specific is always better than general, and it's best to create unique effects rather than trying to think of bigger, stronger versions of known dweomers - that's what manipulations are for!
G>
G> The common formulaic dweomers are as generalized as dweomers should get.
G>
G> If you'd like to make learning dweomers easier and faster, you could just allow a crafter to learn a new one by spending 1IP.

{icon=wrench}
G> #### Converting OSR Spells
G>
G> Vancian styled leveled arcane spells can be used mostly as-is in Pentola with the following guidelines:
G>
G> - Vancian spells can't be manipulated unless they're the sort that allows for damage / effects based on character level, in which case use Magnitude as normal instead.
G> - The effective magnitude of the Vancian spell turned dweomer is double the spell level.
G> - The effective complexity of the Vancian spell turned dweomer is triple the spell level.
G> - If the spell allows for anything other than a reflex or dodge save, use the Resist trait.
G> - Pentola lacks healing and regenerative magic, resurrection magic should be costly and dangerous if it works at all.
G> - Cantrips and 0-th level spells count as complexity and magnitude 1.
G> - These are guidelines, the referee (as usual) has the final say in a conversion.
