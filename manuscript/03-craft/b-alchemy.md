# Alchemy

In addition to the normal means of crafting some folk choose to chase the elusive skill of alchemy.
By this study crafters seek unique and interesting ingredients or cause them to grow in their gardens.

Alchemists, more than most, seek to discover new and inventive dweomers and to produce potions, salves, powders, and foods which produce special effects.

While technically still part of the Craft, crafters may choose to apply dweomers as alchemical formulae using their Alchemy skill bonus instead of their Crafting one.

Except as noted below, applying dweomers through alchemy follows the same rules and steps as ritually applying dweomers.

## Researching an Alchemical Formula

Researching an alchemical formula for a dweomer (as opposed to learning one from a book or teacher or other source) is somewhat dangerous and expensive.

Each formula must be devised for a particular form - pills, wafers, salves, potions, powders, incense - what makes a good and usable incense does not (necessarily) make a good potion.
Each formula requires the combination of two or more ingredients whose alchemical nature matches the effect being created which must also be purchased or acquired.
The magnitude of an alchemical formula is determined when the formula is being researched - the duration and volume are determined by the form while the range is irrelevant.

You'll need to make a hard alchemy test for each research attempt in addition to paying for or acquiring the appropriate ingredients, which will be used up in the experiment whether or not it succeeds.
Each attempt requires a week's preparation and work to accomplish, though multiple experiments may be tried if the alchemist has enough equipment - much of the time is waiting and observing.

To produce a formula with a different magnitude you must research a new formula, though the ingredients may stay the same.
The difference will be in the specific ratios and procedures.

Failure during research is especially dangerous, like action crafting under duress.
When you fail during research, roll once on the Alchemical Mishap table.

The potency of any effects caused by a mishap is equal to the intended magnitude of the formula.

| Roll 2d10 | Alchemical Mishap |
|:---------:|:------------------|
|     02    | **Perfection:** The experiment goes unpredictably perfect, the delay is the minimum for the form and the duration and batch size the maximum, but no matter how hard the alchemist tries, the formula can not be repeated.
|     03    | **Overpowered:** This batch of the formula is more powerful intended with double the magnitude. However, it makes up for this extra magnitude with Tephra from whoever uses the batch as the included ingredients cannot supply it.
|     04    | **Euphoria:** The formula is made correctly, but to take any of it will induce a state of extreme euphoria for the duration in addition to any other effects.
|     05    | **Blood Bubbling:** The batch causes the blood to turn partially to gas in the body of anyone who takes it, inducing terrible pain and halving their body score for the duration.
|     06    | **Vanishing:** The batch hardens and then crumbles into infinitely small grains, dispersing at the slightest motion.
|     07    | **Giggling:** The formula is made correctly, but unpredictably causes a debilititating fit of the giggles (opposed test each moment) for the duration.
|     08    | **Fulmination:** The experiment literally blows up as the magic energies mix with too much volatility, inflicting M damage on those who are nearby.
|     09    | **Burning:** The formula burns uncontrollably, igniting a hot conflagration that consumes the ingredients and possibly nearby equipment.
|     10    | **Sickening:** The formula is a failure, noxious gases escaping and causing everyone nearby to vomit uncontrollably for 1d6 moments.
|     11    | **Slippage:** The formula is a failure and drains the alchemist of 1d4 Tephra as the magical energies fluctuate dangerously.
|     12    | **Underpowered:** The formula is "successful" but only at magnitude 1.
|     13    | **Disorienting:** The formula is "successful" but includes a side effect which makes all Flax tests hard for the duration.
|     14    | **Spillage:** The batch expands beyond its containers, spilling onto everything near by and causing chemical burns (1d6 Blood) to everything it touches.
|     15    | **Shattering:** The batch petrifies everything close, shattering into dangerous shards in 1d4 moments.
|     16    | **Freezing:** The batch sucks all of the heat from the area nearby, freezing everything solid in 1d6 moments.
|     17    | **Maddening:** The fumes from this batch rapidly expand to fill the room, inducing a random madness in those who breath it in.
|     18    | **Puddling:** The noxious particles from this failed batch destabilize any solids they come in contact with, causing them to liquify.
|     19    | **Necrotizing:** This batch bubbles over and expands violently, seeking out living flesh nearby and causing it to begin to rot immediately.
|     20    | **Tephratic Inversion:** The experiment goes horribly awry as magic itself burns out, drawing all nearby magic and energy into it at a rate of 2d4 Tephra / moment. When the Tephra is drained from nearby living creatures it instead drains Blood until death or escape. This terrible mishap will drain the magic from creatures and items alike, destroying them.

## Producing Alchemical Items

Once an alchemist has acquired a formula, by learning or experimentation, they are free to attempt to create a batch of that formula using their alchemy skill.
To do so they must acquire the appropriate ingredients, spend a single day, and make a normal alchemy test.

Failure wastes the ingredients but is otherwise safe unless the test is botched, in which case a mishap occurs.

### Forms

- **Pills:** Alchemical forumlae prepared as pills must be ingested to take effect and do so in 1d4 hours, lasting for 2d6 hours.
  The delay and the duration are determined when the pill is created and are the same for all pills made from that batch.
  The magnitude of the pills degrades by one per month.
  A single batch makes 3d4 pills.
- **Wafers:** Alchemical formulae prepared as wafers must be place in the mouth to take effect and do so in 1d4 minutes, lasting for 1d4 hours.
  The delay and the duration are determined when the wafer is created and are the same for all wafers made from that batch.
  The magnitude of the wafers degrades by one per week.
  A single batch makes 2d6 wafers.
- **Salves:** Alchemical formulae prepared as salves must come in contact with the bare skin to take effect and do so in 1d6 moments, lasting for 2d4 minutes.
  The delay and the duration are determined when the salve is created and are the same for all salves made from that batch.
  The magnitude of the salves degrades by one per day.
  A single batch makes 1d6+1 salves.
- **Potions:** Alchemical formulae prepared as potions must be drunk to take effect and do so in 2 moments lasting for an hour.
  The magnitude of the potion degrades by one per day if the potion is not stoppered.
  A single batch makes 1d4 potions.
- **Powders:** Alchemical formulae prepared as powders must be inhaled to take effect and do so immediately, lasting for 2d4 moments.
  The duration is determined when the powder is created and is the same for all powders made from that batch.
  The magnitude of the powder degrades by one per day.
  A single batch makes 1d6 portions of powder.
- **Incense:** Alchemical formulae prepared as incence must be burned and inhaled to take effect and does so in 1d4 moments lasting for 3d6 minutes.
  The delay and duration is determined when the incense is created and is the same for all incense made from that batch.
  The magnitude of the incense degrades by one per week.
  A single batch makes 2d8 caps of incense.

### Qualities

All alchemical ingredients have particular qualities.

- **Abjuring:** All dweomers which protect from hostile action and intent require an ingredient with this quality.
- **Anatomical:** All dweomers which modify or influence the body require and ingredient with this quality.
- **Base:** All dweomers require at least one element with this quality.
- **Elemental (Element):** All dweomers which project or manipulate a particular element require an ingredient with the appropriate elemental quality.
- **Expensive:** Ingredients with this quality are costly and have their value increased by 1.
- **Imported:** Ingredients with this quality cannot be obtained normally in Pentola and must be purchased from traders from afar and therefore have their value increased by 1.
- **Material:** All dweomers which empower the wielder to control or create physical objects require an ingredient with this quality.
- **Metaphysical:** All dweomers which directly empower the recipient to see, manipulate, or otherwise interact with raw magic require this ingredient.
- **Destructive:** All dweomers which do harm dequire an ingredient with this quality.
- **Mindful:** All dweomers which affect the mind require an ingredient with this quality.
- **Potent:** For every five magnitude of an intended alchemical preparation you must include an additional ingredient with this quality.
- **Rare:** Ingredients with this quality are hard to come by, if they can be bought at all and therefore have their value increased by 1, if they can be found.

## Alchemical Gardening and Husbandry

In Pentola, alchemists don't just make items to be ingested, inhaled, or injected, nor do they always limit themselves to purchasing ingredients with the necessary qualities.

Many alchemists also practice alchemical gardening and husbandry, skills which intertwine knowledge of alchemy, the Craft, and the cultivation of flora and fauna.
Through these endeavors alchemists are able to raise wonders like bushes whose fruit get you drunk, tubers which glow brightly in the dark, birds which can act as diction recorders, fish whose blood is extremely acidic, and more.

> To be detailed further; for now, treat as research similar to other alchemical pursuits to discover a new strain, with double the cost and mishaps being weird failures along the way rather than dangerous ones.
> Use the _Gardening_ and _Husbandry_ skills instead of Alchemy for any related tests.
>
> Referees should err on the side of letting the players dream up and try interesting and weird experiments, but use their best judgement; the more dangerous or useful the creation, the slower it should grow and/or the more expensive and tedious it's care.
