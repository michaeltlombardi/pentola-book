# Miracles

In order to acquire any miracles, the character must be a supplicant, champion, or principal within an organization.
Lay members are not entrusted or empowered with the organization's miracles.

## Acquiring a Miracle

The character must either go to an organizational headquarters or commune with their grantor and request to be empowered with a miracle.
They must invest 2 IP per point of magnitude for the miracle they wish to acquire.
These IP are not regained by leaving the organization or deciding not to use the miracle any longer.

A character can incrementally improve the magnitude of their miracles by spending additional IP during another visit to the headquarters or while communing with their grantor.

## Performing a Miracle

A character must be able to gesture with his hands and be able to chant in order to perform a miracle.
Whenever a miracle is performed, there will always be a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air.
The exact effects are up to the referee and player to decide but will automatically be detected by any creatures who are nearby.

Performing a miracle is automatically successful.
No dice need be rolled, no chance of a fumble or critical either.
Miracles do not cost any PP and always take only a single action to perform.

A character can dismiss any miracle they have performed as a single action.
Ceasing to perform a concentration miracle is immediate and does not require an action.

Miracles do not stack, only the most powerful effect from overlapping bonuses or penalties applies.

When in a direct contest with either knacks or dweomers, miracles are considered to have double their normal magnitude.

### Splitting Magnitude

A character can 'split' a miracle's magnitude into multiple miracles.

For instance, if the character knows the Absorption miracle at magnitude 3, they may choose to perform it as:

- a single magnitude 3 miracle
- three magnitude 1 miracles
- one magnitude 1 and one magnitude 2 miracle.

The split miracles are treated as separate instances and are performed separately.

### Perform Once Only

Each miracle may be performed only once, after which the character must make contact with a Grantor of the organization and petition them for more power.

Supplicants can generally regain miracles in one of two ways:

1. **Visit an Organizational Sanctum Special Event:**
   Most organizations will have special events - holy days, annual galas, quarterly celebrations, etc.
   A character attending these events in good standing can make a relationship test - success will entirely replenish their miracles.
2. **Fulfill Organizational Goal:**
   For supplicants who perform miracles more frequently, they will find that using miracles in the course of furthering the organization is the best means of being able to continue to perform miracles.
   As well as gaining Improvement Points for performing organizational duties, miracles are instantly regained.
   Minor deeds regain one or two point miracles, while major deeds regain miracles that cost three points or more.

The character need not spend any improvement points to regain their miracles.

## Miracle Traits

- **Area (X):** The miracle is targeted at a single spot and effects everything which is closer than X, which is a distance increment.
- **Concentration:** The miracle's effects will remain in place so long as the character concentrates on it.
  Concentrating on a miracle is functionally identical to performing the miracle, requiring the character to continue to gesture with both arms, chant, and ignore distractions.
- **Duration (X):** The miracle's effects will stay in place for the time indicated.
- **Instant:** The miracle's effects take place instantly. The miracle itself then disappears.
- **Magnitude (X):** The minimum strength and power of the miracle.
  If not listed, the minimum magnitude is 1.
- **Permanent:** The miracle's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed.
- **Progressive:** This indicates that the miracle can be acquired and performed at greater levels of Magnitude than the minimum.
- **Ranged (X):** Ranged miracles may be cast upon targets up to the distance increment specified.
- **Resist:** The miracle's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make a hard opposed POW test in order to avoid the effect of the miracle entirely.
- **Dodge:** The miracle's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make a hard opposed test (their BOD vs the supplicant's POW) in order to avoid the effect of the miracle entirely.
  Note that the target must be able to use their reaction in order to dodge.
  In the case of area miracles, the Dodge trait requires the target to dive in order to mitigate the miracle's effect.
- **Touch:** Touch miracles require the character to actually touch their target for the miracle to take effect.
  The supplicant must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire application of the miracle.

| Inspire            | Duration (1 hour), Area (Nearby) Progressive                   | This miracle inspires the targets for the duration, granting a +10% bonus to all tests per magnitude.

| Nightmares         | Duration (M days), Resist, Magnitude 2, Progressive            | Inflict terrible nightmares on the target whenever they close their eyes, robbing them of rest and sleep for the duration.

| Shield             | Duration (1 hour), Touch, Progressive                          | Each point of magnitude for this defensive miracle grants the target protection from all incoming effects and attacks, granting M AP and ensuring all incoming magic effects with a magnitude lower than the shield's slough off around the target harmlessly.
| Skysmite           | Instant, Magnitude 2, Progressive, Range (Distant), Dodge      | For each point of magnitude the supplicant can direct another bolt of lighting at a target they can see who is outside, dealing 3d8 lightning damage.
| Slag               | Instant, Range (Nearby), Dodge, Progressive                    | For each point of magnitude the supplicant can cause another metal object in range instantly heat past it's melting point, liquifying violently, by sending a gently glowing bolt of energy at the item.

| Trade Luck         | Permanent, Resist, Progressive                                 | For each point of magnitude the supplicant can trade luck with the target - if the supplicant _grants_ the target their luck, the target will treat their next hard test as an easy one and the supplicant will treat their next easy test as a hard one. If the supplicant _takes_ the target's luck, the target will treat their next easy test as a hard one and the supplicant will treat their next hard test as an easy one.

For each point of magnitude the supplicant can specify an additional word to describe the ward.
